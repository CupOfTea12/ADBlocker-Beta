# ADBlocker-Beta
my own adblocker created in python

# How to use
When you run this code, it will create a GUI window with a button to block ads and a label to display the result.

To use this app, click the "Block Ads" button. The app will download a blocklist from a URL and add the blocklist entries to the hosts file, which will prevent your browser from accessing known ad servers. The app will display a message saying that ads have been blocked and you will need to restart your browser for the changes to take effect.

Note that this is a more advanced ad blocker that uses a blocklist to block ads. The blocklist used in this app is maintained by the community and may include false positives or block legitimate websites. Use at your own risk.
